Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28Ã—28 pixels) of clothing items from 10 categories, including shirts, trousers, shoes, and bags. It is intended as a more challenging, drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST handwritten digits dataset and is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.
